<h1>The missing startup operating system</h1>
<p>Run your projects, goals, and processes like a high performance startup.</p>

<h2>Why Operately?</h2>

Running your startup with project management tools and Notion documents? Must be a massive headache. 
We’ve been there with [Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com). Figuring out the right systems was tough 
and implementing them, even tougher. Truth is, every startup needs the same systems to keep 
people aligned and execute well.

That’s why we’re building Operately: to give every startup the tools to become a high-performance 
organization with 10x less effort.
